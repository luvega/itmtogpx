Converts any .itm file of GPS Photo Tagger to a .gpx file.

With processing multiple files at the same time it makes exporting out of GPS Photo Tagger much easier.
You can use the .gpx file for other programs supporting gpx.

Not supported are: Pictures.
Only the gps data will be exported (If you use a gps tracker like Travel Honey etc)
